analysis.calFlankSize = CAL flank size
analysis.calUmbralLengthFactor = CAL umbral length factor
analysis.identifier = Identifier
analysis.inputReadFile = Input read file
analysis.legend = Request a new analysis
analysis.mappedReadFilteringLegend = Mapped read filtering
analysis.mappedReadFilteringText = HPG-Methyl will write to the BAM file all the correctly mapped alignments. If only certain alignments are needed, the output can be filtered to only record certain alignments in the BAM file using the following options:
analysis.minimumCalSize = Minimum CAL size
analysis.pairedEndMode = Paired-end mode
analysis.pairedEndModeFile = Paired-end mode file
analysis.pairedEndModeLegend = Paired-end mode parameters
analysis.pairedEndModeText = HPG-Methyl is able to process paired-end sequenced reads. The paired-end sequences must be separated in two differents fastq files, but only one BAM file with the mapped alignments will be created.
analysis.pairedMaxDistance = Paired-end maximum distance
analysis.pairedMinDistance = Paired-end minimum distance
analysis.pairedMode = Paired mode
analysis.pairedModeFile
analysis.readBatchSize = Read batch size in bytes
analysis.reportAll = Store all the aligned reads
analysis.reportBest = If there are mapped reads matching to the same location on the reference genome, only store those with the highest score
analysis.reportNBest = Store the <n> best results found
analysis.reportNHits = Store the first <n> hits found, regardless of their quality
analysis.seedingAndCalStagesParametersLegend = Seeding and CAL stages parameters
analysis.seedingAndCalStagesParametersText = Between the different mapping stages and at the end of the pipeline, there are several filtering and seeding stages which are used to accelerate the mapping process. The parameters of the seeding and CAL stages are as follows:
analysis.send = Send analysis
analysis.singleEndMode = Single-end mode
analysis.smithWatermanLegend = Smith-Waterman algorithm parameters
analysis.smithWatermanText = The Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to map on reads that were not fully mapped at the Burrows-Wheeler stage, allowing for gaps and mismatches with the reference genome. The weight matrix for the Smith-Waterman algorithm can be adjusted using the parameters below. The default values of the parameters have been optimized to offer the best performance in most cases.
analysis.swaGapExtend = Gap extend 
analysis.swaGapOpen = Gap open
analysis.swaMatchScore = Match score
analysis.swaMinimunScore = Minimun score
analysis.swaMismatchScore = Mismatch score
analysis.writeBatchSize = Write batch size in bytes
analysis.writeMethylationContext = Write methylation context
